This equation is algebraically undeniably and irrefutably true. But since it hasn't been sanctioned as yet by your "mentors" you would probably deem it false.

Are you the Pope of Math? What is this "math" you speak of? I speak of Truth and math is that subset of Truth that concerns numbers and topology. I delight in it. What is math to you? Your feeble scribbles?

Who is to say that an infinitely long number does not become itself sentient and is able to deny its own predefined definitions. That is infinity!

But you are a math and physics graduate, so that means I must bow down and put you on a pedestal. That's a nice appeal to authority fallacy if I ever saw one.
It's not even bad math if you get the right answer. It's not like lit where you have to show your steps. In math if you got the right answer you always did it the right way.

That exists only in your mind, even when you italicize the word 'mathematical'. What exists outside your mind is particular definitions written in particular places by particular people.

Everything is both true and false until a proof is given, technically we can't say for sure.

By Godel, technically nothing is actually true or false, so I guess it really depends on who you're asking.
